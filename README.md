# GuessTheFlag

Getting more and more into SwiftUI. Created app as a **simple flag guessing** (knowing) game.
Paul said once in a video... if you can do it better, do it. So... sitted some few hours to download all world flags, writed all the countries and had a lot of fun creating it... (plaing too... :) )
Hope you will have a little bit of fun and this game will challange you also :)
